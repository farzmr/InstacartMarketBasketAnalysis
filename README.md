# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed customer purchasing patterns by cleaning and organizing the data, and performing exploratory data analysis. I created three interactive dashboards in Tableau to highlight key insights such as top products per category, purchase frequencies, and order times.

## Dashboards

I have uploaded a file named `dashboards_picture` which includes pictures of the three dashboards I created in Tableau. These dashboards feature various filters and views to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.

## Dataset

To recreate the dataset used in the dashboards, I have also uploaded a dataset relation picture. This visual aid will help you understand how the data is structured and related.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link:
